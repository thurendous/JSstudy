# HTTP
HTTP is a common language between server and browser.  
We build our front-end side programme and they do not talk to any server unitil now.  
actually they talk to some server.  

- request: means the requests sent by the browser. 
- response: reponses sent by the server.

The **WORDS** you usually use: 
- GET:get something from the server
- POST:send some data to server
- PUT:gonna send you some data to update
- DELETE:delete some data on the back-end.
By using the words and the languages you can build the app of your dream.
