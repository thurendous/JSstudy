## Data Types and Variables
7 different data types and variables
- undifined
- null 
- boolean
- string
- symbol
- number
- object: store a lot of data and functions

var myName = 'Beau'  
myName = 8  
let ourName = 'freecodecamp'  
const pi = 3.14  

**the difference among them**  
var: to use the varible in all the program
let: only be used in the scope of where you declared that
const: some varible that should never change, if you try to change it you are going to get an error

declaring variables and assigning variables  
declaring varibles `var a;`  
assigning varibles `var b = 2;`  
`a=7;`  
`b=a;`  
`console.log(b);`

## Initializing Variables with Assignment Operator
`var a = 9;`  
This is the way to do it.

## Uninitialized Variables
`var a;`
This is uninitialized
